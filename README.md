# Asynchronous-Images-Download
Script to download images using aiohttp and asyncio very fast without any errors like RunTime error.

Works for windows aswell.

Lists of URLs can be used instead of one.


Average time taken for writing 500 images from URLs is 6.13 seconds. In other words, almost 82 images per second.
